# Movie_Recommendation_System
Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based solution designed to provide personalized movie suggestions to users. It leverages advanced filtering techniques such as content-based filtering (which suggests movies based on similar characteristics like genre, actors, or directors) and collaborative filtering (which recommends movies based on the preferences of users with similar taste). By combining both approaches in a hybrid model, the system delivers highly relevant recommendations tailored to the userâ€™s unique preferences.

The system uses the popular MovieLens dataset, which includes movie ratings, genres, and user interactions, allowing it to effectively learn and predict what kind of movies a user might enjoy. The project is built with Python and utilizes libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Surprise, with the option to incorporate deep learning models using TensorFlow or PyTorch.

This tool is ideal for anyone looking to explore recommendation systems or develop their own personalized movie suggestion platform.
