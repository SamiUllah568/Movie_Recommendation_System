## Overview

This Movie Recommendation System uses data from the TMDB (The Movie Database) to recommend similar movies based on user input. The system leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze movie descriptions and features.

## Dataset

The project utilizes two datasets:

1. **tmdb_5000_credits.csv**: Contains information about the cast and crew of movies.
2. **tmdb_5000_movies.csv**: Contains metadata about movies, including titles, budgets, genres, keywords, and overviews.

## Features

- **Movie Similarity**: Recommends movies based on the similarity of their attributes.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Processes and analyzes textual data to improve recommendations.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to include more features or different datasets.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can clone this repository and install the required libraries using pip.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamiUllah568/Movie_Recommendation_System.git
